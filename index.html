    <h2>Research Topics</h2>
    <p>
      In the Department of Environmental Sciences, we focus on research that
      addresses global ecological issues. Of the ideas you proposed, the
      following captured our attention:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The effects of urban pollution on local biodiversity.</li>
      <li>
        Analyzing the impact of climate change on glacial melt rates in Northern
        Hemisphere regions.
      </li>
      <li>Developing eco-friendly alternatives for single-use plastics.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Please provide more details on each topic, including your projected
      timeline, required resources, and any specific methodologies you plan to
      employ.
    </p>

    <h2>Fieldwork Experience</h2>
    <p>
      In response to your question about field experience, I am a strong
      advocate of field-based learning. Some of my notable research expeditions
      include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Amazon River Water Analysis</strong>: Conducted an extensive
        survey of pollutants in tributaries of the Amazon River.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sahara Desert Soil Study</strong>: Explored microbial life in
        arid environments, contributing to our understanding of desert
        ecosystems.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Arctic Glacial Retreat Observation</strong>: Monitored glacial
        changes over two decades, providing data for climate impact studies.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
    <p>Dr. Jonathan Foster</p>
